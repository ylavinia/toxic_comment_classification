# Toxic Comment Classification

In this project, I analyzed the textual nature of Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data) from Kaggle, computed the GloVE (token-level)and SBERT (sentence-level) embeddings, visualized the embeddings using UMAP and PCA, and performed classification task using BERT. I also included the presentation slides (in pdf) that I used for the project.
